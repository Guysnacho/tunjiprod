                        There's a growing number of people that need Software Engineering services, from hotels that
                        handle their booking by hand to student led orgs that don't have the skills (yet), to Nations
                        caught
                        unaware or lacking because they have other pressing issues like infrastructure. Infra like
                        roads, not
                        like terraform.

                        Working with MCBIOS has taught me that smart people do cool things. Whether that's
                        understanding how medicine interacts with cells or publishing their findings, a lot
                        of this work is waaaayyy out of my scope (currently) but that doesn't mean there
                        isn't a place for change.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Letting smart people focus on doing smart things is the goal, I'm glad to scaffold tooling
                        that makes that job easier. For me, that's the MCBIOS website collection. - <a target="_blank"

                        If I'm up, then we're all up. I live by this with the work I do on the job and I try to
                        embody this when family comes through with an app request.

                    <p>
                        Shockingly, we don't have access to engineers to build every app our heart wishes for. We're
                        not trust-funders and nepotism hasn't blessed us. Most of us are 1st generation immigrants that
                        are trying to survive. I want to bridge this gap.
