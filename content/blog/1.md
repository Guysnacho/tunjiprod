I chose to rewrite my portfolio site and if you're reading this then, [welcome](/blog/readme){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400}.
Building a portfolio site is the quintessential software engineer's side project. We get to learn a frontend
framework or tool and express ourselves through lines of code, oftentimes in ways that we can't on the job.
Usually following some guide or tutorial. They are (or at least can be) poster boards of who we are and the
things we learn along this lil lifelong journey.

blurb: This is what I told myself every time I went to my site and took a gander. Fighting back the cringe and ignoring the questions that came up like
items:
  - blurb: Why'd you choose green for the project cards?
  - blurb: You do know the logo isn't centered right? Because everyone else knows‚Ä¶. yeeaaah just keep scrolling.
  - blurb: Do I need a whole database for just this? Supabase isn't free.
  - blurb: Do I really wanna showcase this? :/

### We're our hardest critics

[You can check out version 1 here](https://release-test--tunjiprod.netlify.app/){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400}
but the long and short of it is the project that I was so proud of didn't grow with me. That was a bitter ass pill to swallow.

::blurb
You mean to tell me the gigantic green cards weren't super sick? They were a lil gaudy? The admin page was just repurposed in the TwoTone App?
(More on that in anouther article.) THE NOTEBOOK BACKGROUND WASN'T CUTE?!??! Our internal voices can be brutal. I did end up finding a couple
of things I was and will forever be proud of and its these little gems that matter the most.

So instead of sulking about what 2022 Sam made, I figured I'd make something that I can be proud of. Maybe knocking out some side-missions along the way.

### Goals

Whenever I start a new project the goal is to learn and/or do something cool and this wouldn't be an exception. 
[Funilly enough that rule came from this project in 2023 using the exact same framework I rewrote it with](https://github.com/Guysnacho/tunjiprod/commit/c3fd93eac251e1f9067e3e23485481c87a115b0a){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400}.
This time the site needed to serve a purpose and look good while doing it. Thankfully I already had a head start
on some side-missions to knock out -

items:
  - blurb: The notebook background is cute, whatever I made needed to keep it
  - 
    blurb: Hand drawn everything needed to make a return
    sublist: 
      - We're making it too easy for the AI to take over
      - Is there a better way to show some personality than writing?
  - 
    blurb: Try to field test Vue for real this time
    sublist:
      - I gave up on it the first go-around. Lets see if its an "I'm bad" or "its bad" type of situtation
  - blurb: Make something I'd actually use

::blurb
What you see now is the *final* product (v.2-rev12). *Final* because this, like [TwoTone](https://twotone.app){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400}
will be lifelong projects. It wasn't always this pretty and now I'll breakdown the trials and tribulations
(learning Vue, getting over the framework magic, finally getting a little bit more comfy with CSS, and
conquering some demons along the way).
::

## Personal Pains

### CSS: Not as scary as I thought

::blurb
Self-explanatory but let's break it down. Vue allows (if not forces) you to define your styling
and js scripts within the same file. Cute and convenient until you actually need to style something.

Tailwind bridges most of the gap but if you want something actually done like handling an animation
or adding overlays on a background image of a site... then you've got no choice.
::

### üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Framework Magic ‚ú®

::blurb
Frameworks are a blessing and a curse. Take Spring Boot for example.
::

items:
  - blurb: Provides plenty of helpful defaults
  - blurb: Handles tested solutions for truly hard problems
  - blurb: Usually operates in silence until you break something.

::

::blurb
Its all fun and games until you need to customize a factory for the first time.
With learning Vue and Nuxt, it was fun and games until I couldn't distinguish
installed components/modules from my own components or until I couldn't figure
out why tailwind wasn't working or even worse, why my Blog pages weren't loading
as expected.
::

::blurb
*Spoilers - Don't forget your `setup` anotation in script tags.*
::

::blurb
A lot of these problems can be solved by actually reading through the docs and
were readily available enough that I can't really complain. If I understood the
framework a little bit more instead of just diving in or if I read a bit more then
I wouldn't have fought with my app for 2 days.
::

### Nuxt Content

::blurb
Depending on where you find out about this Nuxt module, you might end up on the
blessed Nuxt Studio docs. I wanted to write all of my articles in this web-based
markdown editor and ship content that way. I figured I'd follow the simple
installation docs and add Nuxt Studio to my project.
::

::blurb
Weird that I need this to enable a web editor but its whatever, maybe some extra
binding is needed.
::

::blurb
Turns out [the entire site was defunct](https://nuxt.studio/docs/get-started/introduction){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400}.
After leveling up my reading comprehension I found out that it wasn't an issue and
Nuxt Studio absorbed into the Nuxt Content docs which helped me maintain my sanity.
No real need to juggle docs that do the same thing. Besides that, the rest of
this was smooth sailing.
::

## Wrap Up

::blurb
I'm really glad I came back to this project and gave it the time it deserves. Not
only that, its also a huge full circle moment for me to come back to Vue. Its the
first framework that I took seriously and using it for my personal portfolio just
feels right.
