We get to learn a frontend framework or tool and express ourselves through lines of code, oftentimes in ways that we can’t on the job. They are (or at least can be) poster boards of who we are and the things we learn along this lil lifelong journey.

So I chose to rewrite my portfolio site. Building a portfolio site is the quinteisential software engineer side project. We get to learn a frontend framework or tool and express ourselves through lines of code, oftentimes in ways that we can’t on the job. They are (or at least can be) poster boards of who we are and the things we learn along this lil lifelong journey.

Now that I've finally hit the base requirements that companies put on their entry level apps, I've decided to showcase the work. Put it on a pedestal if you will. With a bow. And some icing.

### "The work speaks for itself."

::blurb
There's a common saying that you should `Let the work speak for itself`. I believe that the only place this actually applies is food. A good steak or stew doesn't have to say much for you to get it but watercolor paintings and code aren't food.

For most creative work whether that's painting, writing, photography or programming, the work is silent. In software engineering specifically good work is made evident by silence. If you built it right, your programs shouldn't make much noise. They shouldn't be yelling at you about errors and clients shouldn't be coming at your neck with complaints. There should be silence.

I got kinda tired of that.

### Since the work can't speak I decided to speak for it

::blurb
This site and these pages are a showcase of my work but also several other passions that I don't want scattered across the web. You'll find me playing with CSS, Vue, music, React, Figma, writing, Golang, photography, video editing and whatever else I'm forgetting right now.
