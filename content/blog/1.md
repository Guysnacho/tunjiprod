So I chose to rewrite my portfolio site. Building a portfolio site is the quinteisential software engineer side project. We get to learn a frontend framework or tool and express ourselves through lines of code, oftentimes in ways that we can't on the job. They are (or at least can be) poster boards of who we are and the things we learn along this lil lifelong journey.

This is what I told myself every time I went to my site and took a gander. Fighting back the cringe and ignoring the questions that came up like
::

- Why'd you chose green for the project cards?
- You do know the logo isn't centered right? Because everyone else knowsâ€¦. yeeaaah just keep scrolling.
- Do I need a whole db for just this? Supabase isn't free my boy.
- Do I really wanna showcase this? :/

### We're our hardest critics

You can check out version 1 here - https://release-test--tunjiprod.netlify.app/ but the long and short of it is the project that I was so proud of initially didn't grow with me. 

- The tooling and admin page that I scaffolded didn't serve any purpose now that I built TwoTone
- There are some gems that I'll keep forever but those weren't cool enough to outshine the things that irked me
  - Inspo card
  - Hand-drawn everything
- I knew I could do much better now with my current toolbox

So instead of sulking about what 2022 Sam made, I figured I'd make something that I can be proud of. Maybe knocking out some side-missions along the way.

### Goals

Whenever I start a new project the goal is to learn and/or do something cool and this wouldn't be an exception. [Funilly enough that rule came from this project in 2023 using the exact same framework I rewrote it with](https://github.com/Guysnacho/tunjiprod/commit/c3fd93eac251e1f9067e3e23485481c87a115b0a). This time the site needed to serve a purpose and look good while doing it.
