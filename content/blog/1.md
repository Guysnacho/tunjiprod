description: So I chose to rewrite my portfolio site. Building a portfolio site is the quinteisential software engineer side project. We get to learn a frontend framework or tool and express ourselves through lines of code, oftentimes in ways that we can't on the job. They are (or at least can be) poster boards of who we are and the things we learn along this lil lifelong journey.

I chose to rewrite my portfolio site and if you're reading this then [welcome](/blog/readme){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400}.
Building a portfolio site is the quinteisential software engineer side project. We get to learn a frontend
framework or tool and express ourselves through lines of code, oftentimes in ways that we can't on the job.
Usually following some guide or tutorial. They are (or at least can be) poster boards of who we are and the
things we learn along this lil lifelong journey.

blurb: This is what I told myself every time I went to my site and took a gander. Fighting back the cringe and ignoring the questions that came up like
items:
  - blurb: Why'd you choose green for the project cards?
  - blurb: You do know the logo isn't centered right? Because everyone else knowsâ€¦. yeeaaah just keep scrolling.
  - blurb: Do I need a whole database for just this? Supabase isn't free.
  - blurb: Do I really wanna showcase this? :/

### We're our hardest critics

[You can check out version 1 here](https://release-test--tunjiprod.netlify.app/){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400}
but the long and short of it is the project that I was so proud of didn't grow with me. That was a bitter ass pill to swallow.

You mean to tell me the gigantic green cards weren't super sick? They were a lil gaudy? The admin page was just repurposed in the TwoTone App?
(More on that in anouther article.) THE NOTEBOOK BACKGROUND WASN'T CUTE?!??! Our internal voices can be brutal. I did end up finding a couple
of things I was and will forever be proud of and its these little gems that matter the most.

  - blurb: The notebook background is cute.

So instead of sulking about what 2022 Sam made, I figured I'd make something that I can be proud of. Maybe knocking out some side-missions along the way.

### Goals

Whenever I start a new project the goal is to learn and/or do something cool and this wouldn't be an exception. 
[Funilly enough that rule came from this project in 2023 using the exact same framework I rewrote it with](https://github.com/Guysnacho/tunjiprod/commit/c3fd93eac251e1f9067e3e23485481c87a115b0a){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400}.
This time the site needed to serve a purpose and look good while doing it. Thankfully I already had a head start
on some side-missions to knock out -

items:
  - blurb: The notebook background is cute, whatever I made needed to keep it
  - 
    blurb: Hand drawn everything needed to make a return
    sublist: 
      - We're making it too easy for the AI to take over
      - Is there a better way to show some personality than writing?
  - 
    blurb: Try to field test Vue for real this time
    sublist:
      - I gave up on it the first go-around. Lets see if its an "I'm bad" or "its bad" type of situtation
  - blurb: Make something I'd actually use

What you see now is the *final* product (v.2-rev12). *Final* because this, like [TwoTone](https://twotone.app) will
be lifelong projects. It wasn't always this pretty and now I'll breakdown the trials and tribulations
(learning Vue, getting over the *Spring*-ish magic, finally getting a little bit more comfy with CSS, and conquering some demons along the way).
