So Mereba came through to Dallas, I wanted to go because I’m a fan and I hadn’t been to a concert in a while. Figured lemme rip the band-aid off with someone I already enjoyed and I think I underestimated her impact.

Walking up to [The Kessler Theater](https://thekessler.org){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400}, a charming art deco movie theater from the 40s, I dropped my shoulders back and relaxed. I muted swirling thoughts of whether my fit was clean (it was), or if I could bring my camera in (thankfully nobody tripped), or why I didn’t listen to her new album in the run-up to the concert.
<br/>
<br/>
Juan, a friend who was down to go to a concert for an artist he'd never heard before, got the assignment and checked out the new album ahead of time. So in between catching up and spilling tea, he gave me a lil sneak peak of some of his faves on the drive up to the venue.

I thought it’d be cute to go in blind, so we walked into this art piece of a building, ordered something silly at the front desk, and entered the main hall with a couple of expectations:  <br/><br/>“I’m sure she’ll sing some of my favorites like [Kinfolk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfdu1LsZ9DA&pp=ygUOa2luZm9sayBtZXJlYmE%3D){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400}, hopefully [Sandstorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHqsrAPgjO0&pp=ygUOa2luZm9sayBtZXJlYmE%3D){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400} [(which she did)](/blog/2/sandstorm.mp4){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400}, and I’ll just experience the new songs in the moment.”

Now that would’ve been a good approach if she didn’t update my favorite song of hers to a track I’d never heard before 3 times throughout the night.

### The Show

Despite her delicate, sometimes airy vocals, intention is felt. Sometimes she’s blissful like on Phone Me (New Fave #1), a smooth bestie anthem with a baseline that tickles the soul while serving as a reminder to check in with the people that really matter.

Other times she cuts sharp but with love, like on Starlight (my baby) - an ode to her son. Words to serve as strength as he’s navigating life. [A bit of reassurance](https://genius.com/Mereba-starlight-my-baby-lyrics#:~:text=inside%0A%0A%5BPre%2DChorus%5D-,There%2C%20there%2C%20there%2C%20there%0AThere%27s%20a%20sun%20on%20the%20horizon%2C%20sweet%20baby%0AEven%20when%20it%27s%20hiding%2C%20you%27re%20brighter%0AYou%27re%20brighter%2C%20yeah,-%5BChorus%5D%0AIt%27s%20not){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400}, [a warning](https://genius.com/Mereba-starlight-my-baby-lyrics#:~:text=Lies%20told%2C%20minds%20broke%2C%20coded%20for%20a%20cold%2C%20cold%20world%0ABut%20you%27re%20gold%20emanating%2C%20my%20sun%0ABlindfold%20to%20those%20dreamers%20turned%20to%20ghosts%0AHope%20they%20find%20what%20they%20lost%2C%20keep%20on%20keeping%20on){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400}, and [a loving outro](https://genius.com/Mereba-starlight-my-baby-lyrics#:~:text=what%20it%20seems-,%5BOutro%5D,-And%20you%20learn){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400}. (New Fave #2) I love this song and maybe you will too.

And sometimes we get a bop like Heart of a Child. A gentle reminder, like most of her music that our souls need to be more than fed, they need to be freed. Its also a reminder that you never really know what Mereba will do on a track from the reversed drums to dropping [a room-shaking chant in the 3rd quarter of a song](https://youtu.be/bLUtlsYxqpU?si=W6KCXPQPIj5f2KE3&t=140){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-400}. (New Fave #3)

Those tickets were worth every penny and although the US leg of the Breeze Grew A Fire Tour is over, the European leg starts on 11.09.2025. Go seize a moment and if you can’t, support their team by buying some of the music!

P.S. - The band blessed us with [a BOMBASTIC outro](/blog/2/outro.mp4){.underline.hover:no-underline.text-green-700.hover:text-green-200} like it was nothing. Like they do this daily, possibly because they have for the past several weeks. All before bringing it back with an encore of Bet.
