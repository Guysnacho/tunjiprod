Yeeeaaaa, finally making a portfolio site. Lil late but fuck it we ball :)
Follow me on a lil journey, fingers crossed I can crush this in about 2 weeks. Entirely cap. 2 weeks from now (12/2/2022) though for sure.
Follow development at [Tunji Productions](https://www.tunjiproductions.com)

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
yarn run dev
```

## The Point

I kinda wanna do a portfolio site. I don't really like the generic project layout tho so I'm prolly gonna add my personal projects too. I put a lil smidgin of my soul in all my projects but now that I've kind of hit a developer groove, I might as well put it in one place.

### Functional Goals

- [x] - Minimal header with handwritten text of Tunji Productions
- [x] - My spiel
- [ ] - Cards with different things I've been up to (music, blurbs, music recs, and video edits)
- [ ] - Design (Maya's art, peeking all over page)
- [ ] - Things I wanna promote
- [ ] - Highlights on things I'm especially proud of

### Learning Goals

There isn't really a point in doing this if I'm not trying something spicy so I'm gonna learn the following (at least)

1. ~~I wanna learn tailwind and get back into Vue~~ Moved away from Vue and with it chose MUI..again
   - I used to love vue before vue 3 migration started but now I wanna take another look
   - Tailwind sounds cool, plus I'm getting a teensy but closed to css
2. Springboot/Docker
   - I wanna make my own Springboot api, I like the framework and it'd be nice to make a dockerized/kubernetes type thing just bc
   - Will handle new card creation and chat. Maybe scheduled events
3. Spotify API (Gotta have music available)
4. Progressive Mobile App or some way for me to conveniently update and/or notify the masses
5. I wanna draw

Alright lets go ~
