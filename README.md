Yeeeaaaa, finally making a portfolio site. A bit late but we move. :)

Follow me on a lil journey~~, fingers crossed I can crush this in about 2 weeks~~. ~~Entirely cap. 2 weeks from now (12/2/2022) though for sure~~ ~~Most definitely 3 weeks from now tho (5/15/2022).~~
Yeah I'm done setting dates on this one.
Follow development at [Tunji Productions](https://www.tunjiproductions.com)

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn

# npm
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
yarn dev

```

## The Point

I kinda wanna do a portfolio site. I don't really like the generic project layout tho so I'm prolly gonna add my personal projects too. I try put a lil smidgin of my soul in all my projects and now that I'm confident in being a developer, I might as well showcase the work.

### Functional Goals

- [x] - Minimal header with handwritten text of Tunji Productions
- [x] - My spiel
- [x] - Cards with different things I've been up to (music, blurbs, music recs, and video edits)
  - [x] Music
  - [-] Videos
- [ ] - Design (Art, peeking all over page)
- [x] - Things I wanna promote
- [x] - Highlights on things I'm especially proud of

### Learning Goals

There isn't really a point in doing this if I'm not trying something spicy so I'm gonna learn the following (at least)

1. ~~I wanna learn tailwind and get back into Vue~~ ~~Moved away from Vue and with it chose MUI..again~~ Went back to Vue, funny how things go full circle. Was a nice exercise.
   - ~~I used to love vue before vue 3 migration started but now I wanna take another look~~
   - Tailwind sounds cool, plus I'm getting a teensy closed off to css
     - Tailwind is cool and I'm glad I'm working closer with CSS. No where near as scary as I thought.
2. ~~Springboot/Docker~~ ~~Standalone API's~~ Project doesn't require a standalone server but I can add one if I want. Will use it for content though so we'll see.
3. Spotify API (Gotta have music available)
   - Gooooot iiiiiiit, took a lil second too. OAuth 2.0 is so awkward at the moment. I'm doing it manually now and that was painful to setup but now I get it.
   - I'll probably use Passport.js/NextAuth later now that I get it
   - Mission accomplished, used the work done here in [TwoTone](https://twotone.app)
4. Progressive Mobile App or some way for me to conveniently update and/or notify the masses
5. I wanna draw
   1. I still wanna draw
6. ~~Might switch to svelte later later. Who knows~~ Used Sveltekit for [TwoTone](https://twotone.app). Glad I did too, different frameworks are cool. Glad I'm not shackled to Next.js.

Alright lets go ~
